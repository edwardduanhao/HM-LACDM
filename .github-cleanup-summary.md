### âœ… 2. Fixed .gitignore

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Changes**:
- Corrected path patterns (from `inst.figures` to `inst/figures/`)
- Removed blanket exclusion of `data/` directory (package data needs to be tracked!)
- Added proper patterns for:
  - R session files (.Rhistory, .RData)
  - RStudio files (.Rproj.user)
  - macOS files (.DS_Store)
  - Generated output (inst/out/, inst/figures/)
  - Compiled objects (*.o, *.so, *.dll)
- Refined PDF exclusions (only exclude generated PDFs, not all PDFs)

**Impact**: Fixed major issue where package data was being ignored

---

### âœ… 3. Updated .Rbuildignore

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Changes**:
- Added exclusions for files that shouldn't be in the built package:
  - inst/scripts/ (example/analysis scripts)
  - inst/out/ (generated simulation results)
  - inst/figures/ (generated plots)
  - .Rhistory, .gitignore, .DS_Store
  - .github/ (CI/CD configuration)
- Kept README.md and LICENSE.md properly configured

**Impact**: Package builds will now exclude development/output files, reducing package size

---

### âœ… 4. Renamed Script File

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Changes**:
- Renamed: `inst/scripts/signlerun.R` â†’ `inst/scripts/singlerun.R`
- Fixed typo in filename

**Impact**: Corrected naming consistency

---

### âœ… 5. Cleaned Git Tracking

**Changes**:
- Attempted to remove .Rhistory files from tracking
- Files were already untracked (previously ignored)

**Impact**: Session history files properly excluded

---

### âœ… 6. Added NEWS.md

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Changes**:
- Created NEWS.md for version 0.1.0
- Documented all features in initial release:
  - Variational inference algorithm
  - GPU acceleration
  - Data generation and model fitting functions
  - Visualization tools
  - Real data examples
  - Example scripts
- Listed all dependencies

**Impact**: Standard changelog for tracking package versions and features

---

### âœ… 7. Created Package Vignette
